# Trees
## Common Terminology
* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes.

* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

## - Depth First:  is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

### Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

1. Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`

```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- pre-order output of tree node's values

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.left is not Null
        preOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        preOrder(root.right)
        ```
2. In-order: `left >> root >> right`
```
ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)
        ```
3. Post-order: `left >> right >> root`
```
ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value
```
## - Breadth First: Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

```
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while ! breadth.is_empty()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
```
## - Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

```
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while ! breadth.is_empty()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    for child in front.children
        breadth.enqueue(child)
```

## Big O
The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n).

## Binary Search Trees

Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.

## Big O
The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
