## What is an EC2 Instance?

An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform; EC2 is a service that enables business subscribers to run application programs in the computing environment. It can serve as a practically unlimited set of virtual machines (VMs).

Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.

## EC2 instance types:

* General purpose. A general purpose instance is a VM that is designed to handle a variety of workloads.

* Compute optimized. Compute optimized instances are used to run big data applications that require large amounts of processing power and memory on the AWS cloud.

* Graphics processing unit (GPU). These instances provide a way to run graphics-intensive applications faster than with the standard EC2 instances. 

* Memory optimized. Memory optimized instances use a high-speed, solid-state drive to provide ultra-fast access to data and deliver high performance. 

* Storage optimized. Storage optimized instances are ideal for applications that require high I/O performance, such as NoSQL databases that store and retrieve data in real time.

* Micro. A micro instance is meant for applications with low throughput. The micro instance type can serve as a small database server, as a platform for software testing or as a web server that does not require high transaction rates.
