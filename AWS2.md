Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

## Use cases
* Build a data lake.

* Back up and restore critical data
* Archive data at the lowest cost

## What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

## Why is AWS Lambda an essential part of the Serverless architecture?
When building Serverless applications, AWS Lambda is one of the main candidates for running the application code. Typically, to complete a Serverless stack you’ll need:

* a computing service

* a database service; and
* an HTTP gateway service.

## What are the most common use cases for AWS Lambda?
Due to Lambda’s architecture, it can deliver great benefits over traditional cloud computing setups for applications where:

- individual tasks run for a short time

- each task is generally self-contained
- there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

## Benefits of using AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda has a few unique advantages over maintaining your own servers in the cloud. The main ones are:

Pay per use. In AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute your functions use, plus any network traffic generated. For workloads that scale significantly according to time of day, this type of billing is generally more cost-effective.
‍
Fully managed infrastructure. Now that your functions run on the managed AWS infrastructure, you don’t need to think about the underlying servers—AWS takes care of this for you. This can result in significant savings on operational tasks such as upgrading the operating system or managing the network layer.

## What does this mean for an SMB?
CDNs are something that larger companies are more likely to implement. The main reasons why company want to use CDNs are to improve Internet website load speeds, content delivery speeds, and to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to and improve defenses against Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).
