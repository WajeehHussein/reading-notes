# Access Control (ACL)

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

## Benefits of RBAC?

With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

The data breach you prevent may be your own.

## RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL

There are some alternatives for/variations of RBAC, including:

Access control lists (ACL) — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.

### Attribute-based access control
Attribute-based access control or ABAC is a model which evolves from RBAC to consider additional attributes in addition to roles and groups. In ABAC, it is possible to use attributes of:

- the user e.g. citizenship, clearance

- the resource e.g. classification, department, owner

- the action

- the context e.g. time, location, IP.
